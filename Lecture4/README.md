# Plotting

In the fourth lecture, I will introduce some basic plotting commands; illustrate how to generate and close figure windows, and how to combine multiple plots within a single set of figure axes; how to adjust the x and y axis limits of your figures; add various text labels to your figures; edit the other properties of the figures you produce; produce multiple figure panels within a single window; generate more advanced plots; and, finally, how to save or export these figures into various different file formats
